# User Registration Form – Client-Side Validation

This project is a simple and clean **user registration form** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It demonstrates how to implement **client-side form validation** using basic JavaScript string methods and conditions.

Users must enter a valid **username, email, and password**.  
If input is invalid, the form displays helpful error messages.  
If everything is correct, the form displays a success confirmation message.
